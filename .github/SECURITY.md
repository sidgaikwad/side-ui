## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

   - Use subject line: `[SECURITY] Brief description`

### 📝 What to Include in Your Report

- **Description** of the vulnerability

### 🏆 Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help keep our community safe:

- Credit in release notes (with permission)
- Acknowledgment in our security hall of fame
- Potential bug bounty (for critical issues)
