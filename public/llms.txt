# Siddcn - Terminal UI Component Library

> Siddcn is a terminal UI component library built with React Ink that provides beautiful, accessible, and extensible components for building terminal-based applications.

## Overview

Siddcn is designed for developers who want to create beautiful terminal user interfaces using React. It provides a collection of pre-built components that can be browsed and previewed directly in your terminal via SSH or CLI.

## Key Features

- **React Ink Based**: Built on top of React Ink, providing a familiar React development experience for terminal UIs
- **SSH Access**: Browse and preview components remotely via SSH, similar to terminal.shop
- **6 Built-in Themes**: Choose from beautiful themes or create your own custom theme
- **Vim-style Navigation**: Navigate with familiar vim keybindings (h/j/k/l) across all components
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add new component types in minutes with the simple registry pattern

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g siddcn

## Architecture

Siddcn uses a monorepo structure with:

- `packages/siddcn`: Core CLI package with components and SSH server
- `apps/docs`: Documentation site built with Fumadocs
- `apps/website`: Marketing website with component previews
- `apps/examples`: Example implementations and demos

## Theming

Siddcn includes 6 built-in themes:
1. Default - Clean and minimal
2. Ocean - Blue-based palette
3. Forest - Green nature tones
4. Sunset - Warm orange/red colors
5. Neon - Vibrant cyberpunk style
6. Monochrome - Black and white

Custom themes can be created by extending the theme configuration.

## Navigation

All components support vim-style navigation:
- `j` or `↓`: Move down
- `k` or `↑`: Move up
- `h` or `←`: Move left
- `l` or `→`: Move right
- `Enter`: Select
- `q`: Quit/Go back

## Adding Custom Components

1. Create component in `src/components/<category>/`
2. Register in `src/components/registry.tsx`
3. Add documentation in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/`
